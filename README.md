A fantasy PvP mobile AR game (Unity & Vuforia)

This was the most ambitious of all the projects. I fell into depression when i realized it was a stupid concept. Imagine working day and night on something for years, only to realize its as stupid as you when you reach the beta... It was a valuable lesson though. I take a required amount of time now each time i think of something before i start materializing it.

This project has an interesting story behind it. It started with another name and a whole different concept. The original idea was a the mobile kid of Pokemon and Total War. The player collected 'spheres' that were complex mechanisms each one unique and battled with them against others in a map. I still cant figure out what exactly was strategic about that but anyway. 

One night i was sitting with an old teacher of mine talking about AR, that around 2015. That night i returned home and after some research i did it. I made Unity project a cube on a paper with a stamp i was holding. I felt like a genius. Day by day i developed that cube to be a whole arena, add a nice UI and replaced the spheres with characters, one for each player. Added an account system with SQL & PHP (classicaly), a gesture system for the skills and used most of the time trying to make that whole thing run smoothly on a 2015 Galaxy Note 5. Guess what, i did it :D. After countless optimizations i made that game with animations, the arena and the effects run @60fps. I will always be proud for that. 

During the years of the development there were periods i was thinking it may be a stupid concept, but thinking how much work i had put into it and how 'innovative' it was i couldn't let it go. The project crush syndrome. Until January of 2018 came. I had reached the state of beta, i prepared the play store page and i was uploading the app. And then i canceled, and deleted everything. Just like that. And suddenly my day was empty. And fell into depression. Since then try to first sell something before i make it.
